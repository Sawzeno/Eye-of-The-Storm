# Into the Storm

In the magical world of snow and mountains, a brave adventurer has set out to journey deeper into the storm. As he glides on his ski board, he must navigate through treacherous terrain and dodge obstacles to survive the deadly blizzard. With each passing moment, the storm grows stronger and the obstacles become more dangerous. Will he be able to overcome the challenges and reach his destination?

## Gameplay

The player takes control of the brave adventurer on his journey through the storm. They must avoid obstacles such as fallen trees, stones, big stones, and huge snowballs, which appear at an increasing pace as the storm gets stronger. The game features two types of obstacles, land-based and aerial, with the latter taking the form of massive snowballs falling from the sky.

To make the journey even more treacherous, the game features an ice mechanic. The player must navigate through different types of ice, including red ice, which increases their speed, blue ice, which restores their health, and black ice, which reduces their health. As the storm grows stronger, black ice snowballs become more frequent, and the journey becomes even more perilous.
